h1. jekyll_ext

<em>jekyll_ext</em> allows you to extend the Jekyll static blog generator without forking and modifying it's codebase.
With this code, not only do your extensions live in your blog directory, but they can also be shared and reutilized.

h2. Installation

<code>gem install jekyll_ext</code>

Now you just need to create the directory <em>_extensions</em> in your blog where all your extensions will live. Any <em>.rb</em> file in that directory or subdirectory will automatically be loaded by <em>jekyll_ext</em>.

IMPORTANT: Instead of using the <code>jekyll</code> command, you should now use <code>ejekyll</code> instead (which is just a jekyll wrapper that loads your extensions).

To get you started, take a look at my own <em>_extensions</em> directory: "my_jekyll_extensions":http://github.com/rfelix/my_jekyll_extensions
